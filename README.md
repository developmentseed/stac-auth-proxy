# STAC Auth Proxy

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently in active development and may change drastically in the near future while we work towards solidifying a first release.

STAC Auth Proxy is a proxy API that mediates between the client and and some internally accessible STAC API in order to provide a flexible authentication mechanism.

## Features

- üîê Selectively apply OIDC auth to some or all endpoints & methods
- üìñ Augments [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) with auth information, keeping auto-generated docs (e.g. [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)) accurate

| `POST`   | `/search`                                      | Read   | Item   | Append body with generated CQL2 query.                                                                     |
| `GET`    | `/search`                                      | Read   | Item   | Append query params with generated CQL2 query.                                                             |
| `GET`    | `/collections/{collection_id}/items`           | Read   | Item   | Append query params with generated CQL2 query.                                                             |
| `POST`   | `/collections/{collection_id}/items`           | Create | Item   | Validate body with generated CQL2 query.                                                                   |
| `PUT`    | `/collections/{collection_id}/items/{item_id}` | Update | Item   | Fetch STAC Item and validate CQL2 query; merge STAC Item with body and validate with generated CQL2 query. |
| `DELETE` | `/collections/{collection_id}/items/{item_id}` | Delete | Item   | Fetch STAC Item and validate with CQL2 query.                                                              |

#### Recipes

Only return collections that are mentioned in a `collections` array encoded within the auth token.

```
"A_CONTAINEDBY(id, ('{{ token.collections | join(\"', '\") }}' ))"
```

## Installation

Set up connection to upstream STAC API and the OpenID Connect provider by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export STAC_AUTH_PROXY_UPSTREAM_URL="https://some.url"
export STAC_AUTH_PROXY_OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL="https://your-openid-connect-provider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
```

Install software:

```bash
uv run python -m stac_auth_proxy
